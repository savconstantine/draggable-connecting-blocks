## Project Description

Create several blocks and implement the following functionality on the page:

1. Move the blocks on the page using the cursor by clicking on the blue body.
2. Add "line" links between blocks. Adding lines is like this: click on the node of block 1, click on the node of block 2. (two nodes must connect with a line)
3. (when moving the block, the lines must also move) the lines can be straight (not flexible)
4. Possibility to add / remove blocks / links.
